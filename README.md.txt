Customizable Transparent Twitch Chat Illustrator! Showing what goes on in twitch chat while watching CS:GO in fullscreen!


So I had some spare time on my hands and came up with this idea that a transparent overlay for twitch chat would be great when watching big E-Sports tournaments at home with friends!


I am somewhat new at programming structured applications but this one does the job and is somewhat customizable as well!


I though that this subreddit might like the idea and perhaps some ideas for improvement could be shared. Also I'm open for making the code open source if any fellow coders are interested.

The dropbox also contains the same showcase video and a few pictures.


I could write on an on about how the program works, but I rather just throw this out there for eveyone to enjoy. Feel free to ask anything!


The program comes with a README file that describes how it works and can be found in the dropbox link.
